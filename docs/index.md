  tagline: The small crates behind ZapFast, Spotifast, Solco, TonePush and Chat with Work. Everything a native egui app needs besides its own interface, extracted from apps that already ship it.

features:
  - icon: 🔤
    title: Text that looks native
    details: Follows the desktop's hinting and antialiasing, bundles Inter with tabular figures, and finds installed fonts for every script Inter lacks.

    link_text: fastframe-text
  - icon: 🎨
    title: Themes people can edit
    details: JSON palettes loaded off the interface thread, eight shared palettes, and live Omarchy theme following with a reveal from the middle of the window.

    link_text: fastframe-theme
  - icon: 🪟
    title: Runs without a window
    details: A tray item on every platform, a headless loop around eframe that brings the window back on demand, and windows rescued from off-screen.
    link: /fastframe-shell/
    link_text: fastframe-shell
  - icon: 🔄
    title: Updates that roll back
    details: Self-update from GitHub releases with signed checksums, package-manager detection, and a helper that restores the previous version if the new one does not start.

    link_text: fastframe-update
  - icon: 🌍
    title: Translations built in
    details: gettext catalogs compiled into the binary at build time. No libintl, no PO parsing at run time, English as the fallback.

    link_text: fastframe-i18n
  - icon: 🔒
    title: Private by default
    details: Logs made for bug reports, with private targets rewritten and panic payloads never written. No telemetry, no hosted services, nothing that phones home.
